                <h1>Webscrapper + Generative language model</h1>
                <p>This project impliments a basic python webscrapper to generate a csv file dataset
                    for use in training a small language model. It uses BeautifulSoup to scrape the
                    site and download the titles. Then a seprate python script trains a model based
                    off GPT2, and then saves the trained model. PyTorch is used for model training.
                    Then, this model is used to generate full titles based of a starting prompt.
                </p>

                <p>Currently the dataset is limited and only contains 1000 titles. The model can start to generate a 
                    meaningful title, but with a shorter prompt it can devolve into nonsense, which is actually pretty
                    funny.

                    500 epochs at a learning rate of 0.00001. The first epochs
                    are able to learn a lot quickly but as it keeps going it is
                    harder and harder to reduce the loss further.</p>

                <p>This is a log plot of the loss each training epoch over 500
                    epochs at a learning rates of 0.0001, 0.00001, and 0.000001.
                    Initially the larger learning rate quickly reached a very
                    low loss but was too coarse to keep going and failed. The
                    smaller learing rate learned steadily but too slow to do
                    anything meaningful over 500 epochs. In the middle an
                    acceptable loss was reached. To fully optimize learning, a
                    reduce learing rate function could be implimented.</p>
